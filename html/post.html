                The frenzied mob that created a riot at the US Capitol building has a lesson for all 
                of us emotion loving Indians. Don’t let your emotions rule you or take over your ability
                to reason. Interestingly, this lesson is cited in the Bhagwad Gita, one of our ancient holy texts.
                In what has to be one of the most bizarre episodes in modern world history, a mob consisting 
                of a mix of Trump supporters, election fraud conspiracy theorists, far right activists and 
                angry rioters stormed the US Capitol building on January 6. Thousands of protesters stormed 
                through the building, disrupting a joint session of Congress. Many of them vandalised and destroyed property.
                The Senate and House of Representatives had to be evacuated, the entire Capitol area had 
                to be locked down. The fact that this happened in broad daylight, in a powerful and developed
                 nation like the US, is what makes the entire episode truly bizarre.
